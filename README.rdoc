= welink_media

welink_media is a RESTful web-based video processor which queues and encodes
videos according to target profiles that you define.  There is a handy web
interface for defining encoding tasks, and a restful web service which takes
encoding commands.

welink_media is written using Erlang/OTP.

== Why would you want one?

If you're not running a server, you probably don't need welink_media, because
there are already lots of great client-side batch processors for all kinds of
different operating systems. However, if you are running a web application,
and you want to process uploaded video, welink_media offers you a convenient
end-to-end media service.

The right way to deal with the uploaded video is to fire up a new thread which
can take over responsibility for encoding the video, while your web app goes
on its merry way.  Unfortunately, this is difficult in some languages (PHP, for
example, doesn't have lightweight threading support), and even in languages
with good threading support it still sort of sucks. With welink_media, all you
need to do to trigger encoding of a video is shoot off an HTTP request, and
everything else is handled for you.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
